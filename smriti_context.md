# Smriti ‚Äì Development Context

## üéØ Goal
Smriti is a conversational memoir platform. It enables family members to record and preserve stories through voice/text, then organizes them into interactive timelines and knowledge graphs. It is designed with multilingual support and generational accessibility in mind.

## üí° Core Concepts
- **Profiles**: Each profile is tied to a relative (e.g., grandfather). Selecting a profile enters their "memory book."
- **Voice-first Recording**: AI-assisted conversational memory capture via mobile app.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Automatically extracted nodes (people, events, places) visualized and linked interactively. Separate from the timeline view ‚Äî users can switch between views.
- **Contextual Side Notes**: Historical, political, or geographical facts appear as inline footnotes within stories.
- **Timeline View**: Chronologically ordered life events, editable and supplemented by user feedback.
- **Archive View**: Raw data transparency ‚Äî audio files, transcriptions, and images without AI processing.
- **Time Capsules**: Audio messages intended for future playback (e.g., ‚Äúfor your 18th birthday‚Äù).
- **Remote Recording**: Conducted via a joinable link (e.g., like Zoom or Riverside.fm) for recording and transcription.
- **Multilingual Support**: Both original and translated versions of each recording are stored and editable.
