## üõ† Advanced Usage

### Manual Data Import (Developer)
If you need to import data programmatically:

```dart
import 'package:your_app/utils/test_data_importer.dart';
import 'package:your_app/storage/qdrant_profile_service.dart';

final profileService = QdrantProfileService();
final importer = TestDataImporter(profileService);
await importer.importTestData('your-profile-id');
```

### Data Structure
Each memory includes:
- **UUID**: Unique identifier
- **Year**: For timeline organization
- **Summary**: Display text
- **Personalized Summary**: AI-enhanced version
- **Categories**: 1-3 category tags
- **Transcript**: Full conversation text
- **Prompt**: Original question that elicited the memory
- **Emotional Content**: Varied sentiment for testing analysis

### Continuation Stories
The home renovation story demonstrates:
- **Original Story**: Base memory with session_count: 3
- **Continuations**: Related memories with original_story_uuid reference
- **Proper Linking**: UI shows combined session view

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Import Fails
- Ensure Qdrant service is running and accessible
- Check network connectivity
- Verify API keys are properly configured
- Try importing in smaller batches if timeout occurs

### Missing Data
- Check that profile ID matches exactly
- Verify Qdrant collections are properly initialized
- Look for error messages in debug console

### Performance Issues
